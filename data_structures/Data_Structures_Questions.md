Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
O(n). Cb called once for each item in tree

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
 O(1). 

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? O(n). 

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? O(2n). Building the heap takes n spots in memory. Output array also takes n spots.
